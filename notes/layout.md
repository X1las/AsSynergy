# Intro

# Limitations

- only a few programming languages
- no writing directly to the cores, reliance on schedulers
- OS limited to windows and linux due to chipset architectures

# Threads & Processors

## Synchroniscity & Asynchroniscity

### Subroutines & Coroutines

### Suspension

# Parallelism

## Degree of paralellism

### Parallel Execution Time (PET)

### Load Balancing

### Idle Time

# Memory

## Shared Memory

## Memory Access Time (MAT)

# Schedulers

# TRIN model

# State of the market

## Python

- main focus
- GIL keeps it from using multiple cores
- multiprocessing allows the use of more cores
- libraries such as tensorflow and numpy use multiple cores in the background

## Java

- server oriented
- handles thread distribution by itself (on the JVM)

## C#

- Similar to Java, but used primarily in game development

## C

- Very accessible and incredibly fast on unix systems
