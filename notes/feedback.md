# Overall

Your reference style is scientific and not APA, in case there are any requirements.

I'm seeing references at the end of paragraphs, it is a little confusing as i'm not sure whether the citations refer to the whole paragraph or just parts if it. I would rather just see references exactly when they are relevant. The fact that you're using the same sources for multiple paragraphs as well makes me somewhat more confused, as if the paragraphs that are not cited do not have a source.

I can't seem to find anywhere that it mentions what kind of learning you're doing, like if it's reinforcement or pattern recognition. Should i assume it's pattern recognition since your dataset does not seem to include correct results?

# Introduction

I could use some sources in general to kind of support the problem as well as show where PDF tables are crucial if this is something you're building your research question on.

When presenting Novo Nordisk for the first time i would like an external reference on how the company works, a reference from their site maybe?

Great buildup, no spelling mistakes and cuts out the problematique rather neatly.

## Research Question

You have two research questions, so you of course will have to choose one, however be mindful that if you go with the first, you'll need to change your introduction to only include TATR.

You shoul remove the top research question, as it seems too easy to answer.

The second research question is good, but you might want to make it more specific later in the writing process.

You might want a sub-question oriented towards the theory, like "what is tatr/detr and how does it work?" as you probably will spend a lot of time explaining it.

# Background & Related Work

You have to write some intermediary text between the title and the PDF subsection

I'm not seeing any related work in this section, consider cutting it out of the title and placing somewhere else.

Feels like you're dedicating a little too much theory space for delivering specifics about PDF's. I see how it's relevant for your project, but it's also relatively available information to those concerned about it.

The section feels a little redundant, like you might just make a headline for AI and PDF as there's no Related work either, and your fields of theory are so specialized it could be mostly condensed into "AI" with subsections.

## PDF

Tables in PDF seems like an important subcategory, you could probably label it as such instead of making it bold.

If your first source is that huge, i recommend always citing it with a page range

I'm not seeing many mentions of PDFs that contain images. They might throw a crux into your project, so maybe they should be mentioned early?

## AI & ML

Nothing to note that hasn't already been said, it's a relatively short and transitory chapter, considering cutting it out should you be lacking characters or extending it to an overarching category of just "ai" and leaving the content as the section's introduction.

Where did you get the image from? Source it unless it's yours

## Deep Learning

The quote seems inconsistent, quoted text should have quotations whereas the reference might be just italic. the page indication should not be included in the title of the book in either cases

The third to last paragraph has a reference that doesn't appear at the end of it.

## Object Detection

You're beginning to introduce references in the middle of your paragraphs now, you should try and keep the referencing consistent.

I'm seeing a lot of sub-titles in bold, i think these should be made into actual sub categories, just make them not appear in the ToC

# Methodology

Model Architecture and Dataset are theory/data collection not methodology, keep the overall section to how you conducted your research

# Experimental Setup

Should probably rename it to experiment* setup, otherwise it sounds like you're not sure about the setup

Is that an actual supercomputer, or just a slightly faster than average computer with a GPU?

Should probably refer to the setup in past tense, as it will be when you finish the report.

# Evalation Metrics

Should probably be past tense as well, as when the report is out it's something you "used" to evaluate it at the time

Should maybe present AP and AR earlier in the theory, explaining what kind of metrics they are, including a reference whether it stays here or goes somewhere else

# Feedback for me

Introduction 50% too naive

Introduction first quote too broad

Narrow down research question

Cache fighting for parallelizing

Make sure the algorithms are parallelable

More sources
